# 🚀 Galactical Conquest - Agent Guidelines & Collaboration Charter

This project involves multiple agents working in parallel:

✅ C++ Expert Agent - Core C++ game logic and performance  
✅ UI/UX Agent - Game menus, assets, animations  
✅ CloudOps Agent - Build automation, CI/CD, deployment  
✅ QA Agent - Testing for gameplay mechanics  
✅ PM Agent - Oversees PRs and merges to dev and main

---

## 🌐 Workflow
✅ Each Agent works only in their assigned branch and worktree  
✅ All commits go to feature branches  
✅ PM Agent handles final merges to dev and main  
✅ Coordinate shared file edits
